# Basketball-Shoes-Inventory
Create an Inventory System for a basketball shoes store. 
The shoe company is a system that offers an inventory organizer for small shoe department stores. With this system an employee will be able to record their inventory, customer purchases, and know whether or not an item is in stock. Moreover, with my system, the shoe store will cut costs on manually recording inventory and purchases or having to create a long spreadsheet to keep up with all the products that are available and the ones that aren't.
